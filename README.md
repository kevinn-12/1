# Gym-Scheduler

The purpose of this project is to create an executable file that atumatically creates a calendar event resulting from making a booking at the Tilburg Sports Center with Google's API. [This](https://github.com/kevinn-12/Gym-Scheduler/tree/origin/dist) is the final result of the project. Once initiated the app will proceed with 2 authentications: the first where you have to choose the Gmail account associated to your Sports Center account, and the second one being the account you wish to create a calendar event on.
